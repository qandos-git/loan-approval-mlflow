# loan-approval-mlflow

## Introduction:

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict loan approval status based on applicant data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains features such as income, loan amount, credit history, and marital status, which are commonly used to assess eligibility for loans.

## Objectives:

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

2. Preprocess the data, including encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features, standardizing all features.

3. Use cross-validation to get generalized results for hyperparmerters tuning.

4. Use pipeline sklearn class for training and evaluation.

4. Train and evaluate classification models to predict loan approval status.

5. Hundling imbalanced dataset.

5. Optimize the model to achieve high F1 score, because both recall and precision are essentiall for loan approval.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset contains:

    - **Features:** Applicant-related details, such as income, marital status, credit history, etc.

    - **Target Variable:** Loan status (Approved or Not Approved).

By analyzing and modeling this data, we aim to create a robust and interpretable solution for loan approval prediction, which could potentially aid financial institutions in making more data-driven decisions
